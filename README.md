# Personal Portfolio 2.0

> *Because my last portfolio was too boring*

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - The React framework that makes sense
- **TypeScript** - JavaScript, but fancy
- **Tailwind CSS** - Because writing CSS is hard
- **Framer Motion** - Animation library that sparks joy

## Quick Start

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# fire up the dev server
pnpm dev

# open http://localhost:3001
# (yes, 3001, because 3000 is mainstream)
```

## Customization

All data lives in `src/lib/data/`:
- `projects.json` - Your cool projects
- `experience.json` - Your professional journey (aka the grind train)
- `skills.json` - Things you good at (or maybe not)
- `social-links.json` - Where people can stalk you

**Pro tip:** You can use markdown in experience descriptions for *fancy* **formatting**!



## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

Just remember: 
- Keep it clean

- Keep it fancy ✨
